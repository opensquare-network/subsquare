## Welcome to SubSquare

Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and SubSquare. (“SubSquare,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

Your use of or participation in certain Services may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.

Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING,YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at anytime, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at subsquare.io, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What are the basics of using SubSquare?

You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user name(“SubSquare User ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your Web3 address information.

You may not select as your User ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

Additionally, you may be able to access the Services by using your account credentials from other services (each, a “Third Party Account”),such as those offered by Polkdadot.js.
