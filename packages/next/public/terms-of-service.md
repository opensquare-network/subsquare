# Terms of Service

> Last update in December 22, 2021

## Welcome to SubSquare

Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and SubSquare. (“SubSquare,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

Your use of or participation in certain Services may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.

Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING,YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at anytime, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at subsquare.io, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What are the basics of using SubSquare?

You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user name(“SubSquare User ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your Web3 address information. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your User ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

Additionally, you may be able to access the Services by using your account credentials from other services (each, a “Third Party Account”),such as those offered by Polkdadot.js. By using the Services through a ThirdParty Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Services.

You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.

You will not share your SubSquare User ID, account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your SubSquare User ID, account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your SubSquare User ID and account.

## What about messaging?

As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the Services, including messages that SubSquare sends you (for example, via email). When signing up for the Services, you will receive a welcome message and instructions on how to stop receiving messages.

## Will SubSquare ever change the Services?

We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of theServices. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason(including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

## What if I want to stop using the Services?

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at [hi@opensquare.network](mailto:hi@opensquare.network) – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.
